# voicemeeterlagfixer
a program that fixes the voicemeeter lag/crackling sound of your mic. 
Created in c++ in a day so if there are any issues then create one [here](https://github.com/Steve987321/voicemeeterlagfixer/issues).
This was just created so you don't have to do it manually in task manager.
